This was the first assignment I completed for my Computer Animation class at Texas A&M.
The goal was to create a looping animation of a helicopter flying through the air using keyframed poses along a spline curve.

--------
There are 5 keyframes, which can be toggled on or off with 'k'
The animation cycles through different parametrization functions with 's' (total animation time is 5 seconds)
	1. Linear time-parameter relationship: the helicopter will take the same amount of time to travel between each keyframe.
	2. (Arc-length parameterization): the helicopter travels with constant speed. Equally spaced points on the spline are drawn.
	3. Ease-in / Ease-out: the helicopter will momentarily stop at the start of the loop.
	4. Custom control function
		the 4 points of the cubic function: (0,0), (0.3, 0.5), (0.7, 0), (1,1)
			the function: 10.71429x^{3}-14.88095x^{2}+5.16667x
			a = 10.71429
			b = -14.88095
			c = 5.16667
			d = 0
Pressing the spacebar will change the camera to follow the helicopter and show the flight from the "pilot's" perspective.
